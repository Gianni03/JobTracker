## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted terracotta (#E07A5F) to convey warmth and reliability, nodding to the 'burnt-peach' of the original design but with a calmer tone.
- Background color: Off-white (#F4F3F0) to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that allows the terracotta to stand out without being too harsh.
- Accent color: A deep teal (#3D405B) to act as a contrasting highlight color; complementing the terracotta and guiding the eye to important actions.
- Body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable body.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) is good for a tech app.
- Use Lucide icons for a consistent and modern look.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with a fixed sidebar and a main content area.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance the user experience.
